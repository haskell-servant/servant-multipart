-- | @multipart/form-data@ Servant API support for servant.
--   see servant-multipart and servant-multipart-client for server- and client-
--   definitions.
--
--   This is mostly useful for adding file upload support to
--   an API. See haddocks of 'MultipartForm' for an introduction.

-- | Combinator for specifying a @multipart/form-data@ request
--   body, typically (but not always) issued from an HTML @\<form\>@.
--
--   @multipart/form-data@ can't be made into an ordinary content
--   type for now in servant because it doesn't just decode the
--   request body from some format but also performs IO in the case
--   of writing the uploaded files to disk, e.g in @/tmp@, which is
--   not compatible with servant's vision of a content type as things
--   stand now. This also means that 'MultipartForm' can't be used in
--   conjunction with 'ReqBody' in an endpoint.
--
--   The 'tag' type parameter instructs the function to handle data
--   either as data to be saved to temporary storage ('Tmp') or saved to
--   memory ('Mem').
--
--   The 'a' type parameter represents the Haskell type to which
--   you are going to decode the multipart data to, where the
--   multipart data consists in all the usual form inputs along
--   with the files sent along through @\<input type="file"\>@
--   fields in the form.
--
--   One option provided out of the box by this library is to decode
--   to 'MultipartData'.
--
--   Example:
--
--   @
--   type API = MultipartForm Tmp (MultipartData Tmp) :> Post '[PlainText] String
--
--   api :: Proxy API
--   api = Proxy
--
--   server :: MultipartData Tmp -> Handler String
--   server multipartData = return str
--
--     where str = "The form was submitted with "
--              ++ show nInputs ++ " textual inputs and "
--              ++ show nFiles  ++ " files."
--           nInputs = length (inputs multipartData)
--           nFiles  = length (files multipartData)
--   @
--
--   You can alternatively provide a 'FromMultipart' instance
--   for some type of yours, allowing you to regroup data
--   into a structured form and potentially selecting
--   a subset of the entire form data that was submitted.
--
--   Example, where we only look extract one input, /username/,
--   and one file, where the corresponding input field's /name/
--   attribute was set to /pic/:
--
--   @
--   data User = User { username :: Text, pic :: FilePath }
--
--   instance FromMultipart Tmp User where
--     fromMultipart multipartData =
--       User \<$\> lookupInput "username" multipartData
--            \<*\> fmap fdPayload (lookupFile "pic" multipartData)
--
--   type API = MultipartForm Tmp User :> Post '[PlainText] String
--
--   server :: User -> Handler String
--   server usr = return str
--
--     where str = username usr ++ "'s profile picture"
--              ++ " got temporarily uploaded to "
--              ++ pic usr ++ " and will be removed from there "
--              ++ " after this handler has run."
--   @
--
--   Note that the behavior of this combinator is configurable,
--   by using 'serveWith' from servant-server instead of 'serve',
--   which takes an additional 'Context' argument. It simply is an
--   heterogeneous list where you can for example store
--   a value of type 'MultipartOptions' that has the configuration that
--   you want, which would then get picked up by servant-multipart.
--
--   __Important__: as mentioned in the example above,
--   the file paths point to temporary files which get removed
--   after your handler has run, if they are still there. It is
--   therefore recommended to move or copy them somewhere in your
--   handler code if you need to keep the content around.

data MultipartForm' (mods :: [*]) tag a

-- | What servant gets out of a @multipart/form-data@ form submission.
--
--   The type parameter 'tag' tells if 'MultipartData' is stored as a
--   temporary file or stored in memory. 'tag' is type of either 'Mem'
--   or 'Tmp'.
--
--   The 'inputs' field contains a list of textual 'Input's, where
--   each input for which a value is provided gets to be in this list,
--   represented by the input name and the input value. See haddocks for
--   'Input'.
--
--   The 'files' field contains a list of files that were sent along with the
--   other inputs in the form. Each file is represented by a value of type
--   'FileData' which among other things contains the path to the temporary file
--   (to be removed when your handler is done running) with a given uploaded
--   file's content. See haddocks for 'FileData'.

                            --   really want to move or copy it in your handler.
